# JAVA PROGRAMS

Java is one of the most popular programming languages
 around, but no one seems to enjoy using it. Well, 
 Java is actually an alright programming language, 
 and since Java 8 came out recently, I decided to
  compile a list of libraries, practices, and tools 
to make using Java better.

Table of contents

 1) Getting started with JAVA.
2. Program1 Folder consists of -

        a)to Calculate the factorial of a number
        b)to print prime numbers using CLA
        c)to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using CLA
3. Program2 Folder consists of -

        a)to find the sum of all the elements in an array
        b)to print all the elements in a 2D array. Get the input from key board
4. Program3 Folder consists of -
      
        Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables 
        within it. USN,Name, Branch, Phone. Write a Java program to create n Student objects and print the USN,
        Name, Branch, and Phone of these objects with suitable headings

5. Program4 Folder consists of -

        a)Program Illustrating Overloading & Overriding methods inJava.
        b)Program Illustrating the Implementation of Various forms of Inheritance.
        c)Program to create and import packages.
        d)create interface named test. In this interface the member function is
        square. Implement this interface in arithmetic class. Create one new class called ToTestInt in
        this class use the object of arithmetic class.
        e)Program Illustrating checked and unchecked exceptions
        f)Program to create customized exception
        h) multi- thread application that has three threads. First
          thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes the square of
          the number and prints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
